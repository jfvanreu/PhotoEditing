# Photo Editing
Photo editing application using the Segement Anything Model (SAM) and Inpaint diffusion model.

In this project, we leverage the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to select a subject on a photo. 
We then replace that subject (or the background) with an image generated by a diffusion model.

The purpose of this project is to become familiar with the SAM model and the diffusion models.
It required a few trials to generate the resulting images.

All work is in the Jupyter Notebook.
